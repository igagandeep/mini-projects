# Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of small, self-contained projects built to practice and demonstrate skills in front-end and full-stack development. Each project focuses on implementing specific features, learning new technologies, or experimenting with different frameworks.

Projects are organized in separate folders, making it easy to explore, run, and modify them individually.
